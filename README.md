# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe program is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and multidimensional arrays. The Board class encapsulates the functionality, protecting data related to the status of the game and each player's progress. Each move made by either player is validated before changes are shown on the grid to ensure a pleasant experience for users of the program.

## The program allows users to:
- Play an intense game of Tic-Tac-Toe in pairs.

## How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Java project in your preferred Java IDE.
- Run the Main.java file to start the program.

- Enter the coordinate of your marker for the game grid.
- The program shows changes on the grid after each move.
